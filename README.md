# Unofficial VK Play Live API

This library is unofficial API (for https://vkplay.live/) and uses undocumented features, so there is no guarantee that it will be fully functional after some time.

Everything here is reverse engineered.

- If I can do something in browser, then this MUST be available through an API
- If I can do something anonymously (without account) then I don't need some_sort of API key or another type of access

### Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Something-Went-Wrong-ORG/unofficial-vk-play-live-api.git YOURFOLDERNAME
cd YOURFOLDERNAME

# Run npm install. That's all!
npm install
```

**Start coding!** `package.json` and entry files are already set up for you, so don't worry about linking to your main file, typings, etc. Just keep those files with the same name.

### Features

- TBD

### Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import VKPLAPI from 'unofficial-vk-play-live-api';
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import something from 'unofficial-vk-play-live-api/dist/lib/something';
```

### NPM scripts

- `npm t`: Run test suite
